    "# Mastering Metrics Ch 5 - Differences in Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences in differences is a technique that works by examining the way a trend changes with a change in some input. In it's simplest form, we just work out (over some period of time) the change in some observable feature of the treatment group and compare it to the change in the same feature for the control group. For example, give one group a drug and the other a placebo and examine which group has more people who lose weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method makes the assumption that the trend *should be* the same which may not be true. Thus, fr such observations to be meaningful, we might want to see evidence of a similar trend is the observed variable in each group before the treatment, or after the treatment is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of applying DD is to use a regression. Here is what that looks like with dummy variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{xt} = \\alpha + \\beta TREAT_x + \\gamma POST_t + \\delta_{DD} (TREAT_x \\times POST_t) + e_{xt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta_{DD}$ is our measure of causal effect (as it will capture the difference between the cases where treatment is applied (by group and time) and those in which either is not true (where it will resolve to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run it for real on some data that I've just written out from the textbook."

    "### What if some groups are very different sizes?\n",
    "We can use 'weighted least squares'. This should not significantly change the result (after all; there's no reason the treatment effect in a large group will be larger, or that we should trust this treatment effect magnitude more) but it reflects the fact that larger groups should have less volatility and thus be more likely to be measured accurately, and a WLS allows us to weight the samples which we trust more for that reason. This should have the effect of increasing the precision (if a set of assumptions are met).\n",

    "Essentially, just pray that the WLS result is similar to the OLS and if so it's a good sign."
